# Air Quality Prediction - Poprad, Slovakia

An air quality prediction system designed to forecast AQI (Air Quality Index) for Poprad, Slovakia using historical air‚Äëquality and meteorological data. The system ingests historical air-pollution and weather data, trains ML models (e.g. XGBoost and LSTM), and serves a predictive model (with a live demo on Hugging Face Spaces). The workflow is fully automated using GitHub Actions: data collection, model training, and deployment all run as scheduled or on-demand workflows.

## üåü Key Features
- **Time Series Recursive Forecasting:** Utilizes an XGBoost model for accurate forecasting.
- **Containerized:** Fully containerized with Docker for easy setup and consistent environments.
- **Automated Pipeline:** CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing and building.
- **Data-Driven:** Uses historical data to train the prediction model.

## üî¨ Methodology

### About Poprad

Poprad is located in northern Slovakia, near the High Tatras mountains. The city's air quality is influenced by:
- **Geographic Location**: Valley position affects air circulation
- **Industrial Activity**: Local manufacturing and transportation
- **Seasonal Variations**: Winter heating and summer tourism patterns
- **Weather Patterns**: Mountain weather systems and temperature inversions

### Data Collection
The project utilizes various environmental parameters that influence air quality:
- **Particulate Matter**: PM2.5, PM10 concentrations
- **Gaseous Pollutants**: NO2, SO2, CO levels
- **Meteorological Data**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure
- **Temporal Features**: Hour, day, month, season

### Data Sources
The project integrates data from multiple sources:
- **Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute (SHM√ö)**: Official air quality monitoring stations
- **European Environment Agency**: Regional air quality data
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Meteorological parameters
- **Local monitoring stations**: Real-time sensor data

### Machine Learning Models
The project implements and compares several ML algorithms:
- **Gradient Boosting**: Advanced ensemble technique (XGBoost/LightGBM)
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: For time series prediction

### Inference
- **Prediction Window of 3 days** - based on last 3 days (inputs), model predicts next 3 days (targets)
- **Recursive Forecasting** - a multi-step time series forecasting method where a model trained for one-step-ahead prediction is used iteratively to generate forecasts for multiple steps into the future

### Evaluation
- Using single metric for model comparison - **The Willmott index** - it gives credit for correlation but heavily penalizes systematic errors that would make the forecasts unreliable for air quality management.
- With recursive forecasting error is cumulative - cannot improve Day 3 prediction without improving Day 1 - so it is enough to **evaluate only last day's results for simplicity**.
- Instead **evaluate each output separately** (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO) as they tend to differ significantly.

## üìà Results and Insights

### Model Performance
The Willmott index (Index of Agreement) based on last day's predictions. Higher the better.

| Model | PM2.5 | PM10 | NO2 | SO2 | CO |
|-------|----------|------|-----|------|------|
| XGBoost | 0.3716 | 0.3599 | 0.4726 | 0.7681 | 0.211 |
| LSTM | 0.2846 | 0.4156 | 0.4476 | 0.6584 | 0.2417 |

### Key Findings
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Higher AQI values during winter months due to heating
- **Weather Dependencies**: Strong correlation with wind speed and atmospheric pressure
- **Daily Cycles**: Peak pollution during morning and evening rush hours
- **Feature Importance**: PM2.5 and meteorological conditions are primary predictors

## ü§ñ Automation Pipeline
The core pipeline consists of the following automated steps, orchestrated by GitHub Actions:
- **Docker Image Build:** On every code push to main, the **Build and Push Docker Image** workflow builds a Docker container containing the project environment and pushes it to GitHub Container Registry. This ensures a consistent runtime for all subsequent steps.

- **Data Fetch (Hourly):** A **Fetch Data Hourly** workflow runs on a cron schedule (hourly) to update the dataset. It pulls the latest Docker image and executes `scripts/fetch_data.py` inside the container, collecting new AQI and meteorological data via the APIs. This automated job keeps the dataset current without manual intervention.

- **Model Training (Weekly):** A Train Model Weekly workflow runs on a weekly cron schedule (e.g. every Monday at 00:00 UTC). It pulls the Docker image and runs `scripts/train_model.py` in the container to preprocess data, train the models, and evaluate performance. By automating training, the model stays up-to-date with incoming data.

- **Model Deployment:** The Deploy Model workflow can be triggered manually. It logs into the registry, pulls the latest image, and runs `scripts/deploy_model.py` inside the container. This step makes trained model available for predictions and updates the live application.

Each workflow reuses the same Docker image to ensure consistency. In summary, code changes trigger a new container build, a scheduled job fetches fresh data hourly, the model is retrained weekly, and an on-demand job deploys the updated model.
